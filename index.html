          David and Yuka are two teenagers from different cultures, who had
          never met before in their lives. They meet when Yuka drops her bike
          outside of Davidâ€™s pizzeria. David offers to fix the bike for her and
          she offers him a slice of pizza, which is his favorite food.

        <p>
          So, David and Yuka make love to the taste of pizza that night. The
          next day they find out that they know each other irl, which was rather
          a surprise for both of them since they didn't have Facebook or
          Instagram. They both found out that their parents are friends in the
          same social circle, so they decide to keep their relationship as an
          innocent secret between two kids who were both in love.
        </p>

          The next day after school, David and Yuka are walking on the street
          when one of our sources flagged down a photographer who was just
          walking by. He took a picture of them together without them knowing
          about it, which turns into an internet sensation.
